* Docker image of the US spine classification system.
** Methods
- Multi-scale and multi-directional feature extraction using LDH
- Pattern classification via MLP
** Data
- Sagittal planes of 3D US volumes collected with motorized transducer from 13 volunteers
** Result summary:
- 97% and 94% accuracy on train and test data, respectively.
** Dependencies:
- docker
- numpy
- opencv
- No GPU!
** Build:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sh build.sh
#+END_SRC

** Run:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
sh run.sh [path to the data folder] [data file]
#+END_SRC

ex: sh run.sh /home/deepinfer/image_data img1.jpg
